   It surprised me the gamification you organized with apps like The Gateway and Time Tracker.
   I met a lot of Cisco Experts that explained the coming features in some Cisco solutions I am interested in.
   A good trick would be to use The Gateway before and during the event in order to know the activities that are taking place.
   I would come earlier in the week so that I could take even more advantage of the event.
